    <h4>Megas XLR</h4>
    <p>There is honestly very few shows that matchup to the <b>Awesomeness</b> that is Megas XLR. Why you might ask? Two words, <b>Giant Robot</b>; Need I say more. Combine that with the action backed story and the released 26 episodes feels realy short. In conclusion I would give almost anything to get a Megas XLR continuation.</p>
